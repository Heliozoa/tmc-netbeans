# Test My Code NetBeans plugin #

This is a NetBeans plugin for the [Test My Code server](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server). It allows downloading, testing and submitting exercises directly from the IDE.

## Temporary build hax ##

Due to http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNBMODULE-138 we include a local copy of `org.codehaus.mojo:nbm-maven-plugin:3.9-SNAPSHOT`
in `nbm-maven-tmp-copy/`. Currently it must be `mvn install`'ed before the main project can build.
