Here lie some useful functional tests that I couldn't get to work with the mavenized build despite hours of fiddling
with dependencies and whatnot. If it's possible to get these to work with NB 7.2 then it's certainly *very* far from user-friendly.
Might try again some day, but for now it's less trouble to test manually, dammit.
